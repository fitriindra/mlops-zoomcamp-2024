# Introduction
## 1.1. Introduction

The are 3 stages for the implementattion of best practices for machine learning:
- Design
- Train the model
- Operate. Machine learning model deployment is part of operate stage

MLOps is a set of practices for automating everything that needs to be done in all of the stages.

## 1.2. Environment preparation

There are several options to configure the environment. In this section we will try to use three different kind of setup: using Github Codespaces, AWS and Google Cloud


### Configuring Environment with Github Codespaces

1. Open github and create/open repository
2. Click on `Code` button, select Codespaces.If there are no Codespaces for the repository, it will show `Create codespaces on main` button

3. New window will open. After the codespaces is created, we can open it in our own VS Code Desktop by selecting menu on the sidebar

4. Install Github Codespaces in VS Code Extensions to use the codespace in VS Code Desktop
5. Install Anaconda distribution
`wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh`
`bash Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh`
6. The codespace can be accessed from the same button in Github

### Configuring Environment in AWS

1. Open AWS console and create an EC2 instance
2. Click `Launch Instance` button to enable the instance
3.
