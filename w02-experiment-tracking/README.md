- ML experiment: the process of building an ML model
- Experiment run: each trial in an ML experiment
- Run artifatcsL any file that is associated with an ML run

Experiment tracking keeps track of all the relevant information from an ML experiment, such as: code, environment, data, model, hyperparameters, metrics, and other logs. The experiment tracking is important because of: reproducibility, organization, and optimization.
